# Game Developer – Unreal Engine (Hobby)

Hi!  
I’m a hobby game developer focused on **gameplay systems and prototyping**.  
I’m looking for people interested in collaborating on a small **non-commercial / hobby project**, with the goal of learning and building a solid portfolio piece together and possibly a good game.

## 🎮 Projects
### Working Inventory system with drop and pick up, also stamina system with sprint

Room spawn system based on stress levels, in this case stress level is high so a random room appears after the story room

when stress goes back to normal story related rooms start spawning again
