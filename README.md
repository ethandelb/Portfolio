# Game Developer – Unreal Engine (Hobby)

Hi!  
I’m a hobby game developer focused on **gameplay systems and prototyping**.  
I’m looking for people interested in collaborating on a small **non-commercial / hobby project**, with the goal of learning and building a solid portfolio piece together and possibly a good game.

## 🎮 Projects
## Current state of the Unreal Project
### Working Inventory system with drop and pick up, also stamina system with sprint

### Stress changes visual effects and is relative to the room

### torch activated nullifies the room light level so that stress will lower
![image](images/UE5project/torchnullify.png)
### Room spawn system based on stress levels, in this case stress level is high so a random room appears after the story room

### when stress goes back to normal story related rooms start spawning again
